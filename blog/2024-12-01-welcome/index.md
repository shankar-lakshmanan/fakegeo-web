Welcome to FakeGeo! This is the first release of the API (v1.0.0) available [here](./../api). It supports many feature and feature collection endpoints with properties for all major GeoJson data types. 

Many other features such as generating contour lines, grid polygons and flight path GeoJson
etc. are planned for future releases.
