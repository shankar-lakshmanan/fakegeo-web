# Introduction

**Effortless geospatial fake data for testing, development, and demos.**

FakeGeo is a simple, user-friendly API designed to make generating realistic geospatial data effortless. Whether you're developing, testing, or showcasing maps, FakeGeo takes the complexity out of creating GeoJSON data. Forget manual data creation or tedious stubbing. FakeGeo lets you focus on what matters most: designing and demonstrating your maps with high-quality geospatial data tailored to your needs.

Key Features:

- Versatile GeoJSON Outputs: Generate features or feature collections with points, lines, polygons, multipoints, multilines, multipolygons, and more.
- Customizable Data Options: Get fixed example features, random features, or collections with optional random properties.
- Dynamic Data Control: Use POST calls with bounding boxes (bbox) or polygon extents to specify the area, and limit outputs to up to 1000 features per request at a time.
- Effortless Testing: Make unit and end-to-end testing of your map components a breeze by using the API to generate realistic geospatial data, eliminating the need to manually create GeoJSON files.
- Streamlined Workflow: Generate data quickly and efficiently for development, testing, or demos without manual GeoJSON creation.
